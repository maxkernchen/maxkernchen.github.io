          <h3>Wifi Ranger</h3>
          
          <p class="project-p">Wifi Ranger is a C# WPF project which calculates the approximate percentage 
            of WiFi coverage for a given router and floor plan.
          It uses Walmart JSON Web Services to retrieve up to date prices 
          and store links for a current list of 10 popular routers.
        
          </p>    
          <p id='wifiranger_calc' class="project-p"> WiFi coverage is calculate by a modified 
            <a class="link project" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss#Free-space_path_loss_in_decibels">
              free-space path loss</a> formula which adds the natural log of the router's power to it.
              Some basic real world testing using simple Android applications proved this method to be fairly accurate. Below is the current formula
               Wifi Ranger uses to calculate the distance, in one direction, covered in meters.
               </p>
             <p class="project-p MathJax">$$m = 10^{\frac{(27.55 - (20 \cdot \log(frequencyMHz) + |dBm| +\ln(power)))}{20}}$$</p>
             <p class="project-p">Frequency is between 2400 - 5800 megahertz for most routers, dBm or decibel-milliwatts is 
               usually -57 which is the lowest Wifi strength for reliable packet delivery.
               Power is different for every router, most of the time higher power = higher range. 
             </p>
