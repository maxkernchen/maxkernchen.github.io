          <p class="project-p">WifiRanger is a C# WPF project which calculates the approximate percentage 
            of WiFi coverage for a given router and floor plan.
          It uses Walmart JSON Web Services to retrieve up to date prices 
          and store links for a current list of 10 popular routers.
        
        </p>
        
          <p id='wifiranger_calc' class="project-p"> WiFi coverage is calculate by a modified 
            <a class="link--light" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss#Free-space_path_loss_in_decibels">
              free-space path loss</a> formula which adds the natural log of the router's power to it.
              Some basic real world testing using simple Android applications proved this method to be fairly accurate. Below is the current formula
               WifiRanger uses to calculate the distance, in one direction, covered in meters.
               </p>
             <p class="project-p">$$m = 10^{\frac{(27.55 - (20 \cdot \log(frequencyMHz) + |dBm| +\ln(power)))}{20}}$$</p>
             <p class="project-p">Frequency is between 2400 - 5800 megahertz for most routers, dBm or decibel-milliwatts is 
               usually -57 or -58 which is the lowest Wifi strength for reliable packet delivery.
               Power is different for every router, most of the time higher power = higher range. 
             </p>
             <p class="project-p">
               You can download WifiRanger below, all that should be needed is to extract all files
                to the same directory and run WifiRanger.exe. Below you will also find a link to the
                 WifiRanger GitHub page.

            <p>Spot My Mood is an Android application which allows users to take a self image and display current emotions.
              These emotions are then connected to a Spotify playlist to best match them.
            </p>
            <p>Spot My Mood is powered by Microsoft's <a class="link--light" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/emotion/">Emotion API </a> </p>
            <p>An image is turned into a bitmap which is sent to Microsoft's Emotion Web Service. Then results are returned in an ArrayList which contains 8 emotions that are ranked from 0 to 1.
              The higher the number the more the emotion is seen. </p>
            <p>These results are then converted into a visual graph using <a class="link--light" href="https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart" >MPAndroidChart </a>

            <h3 id='lynx' class="section__title">Lynx </h3>
            <p >Lynx is a Peer-to-Peer file synchronization application written using Go. 
              Using a shared meta file any machine running Lynx can receive and send files to other machines running Lynx. 
            </p>
            <p>Lynx implements a browser based GUI, which allows for portability between different operating systems
               and the use of modern web design components like Bootstrap and JQueryUI. 
             </p>
            <p>Lynx was part of a capstone project that all students must complete before graduating. This project was a partner project.
               My main responsibilities were the design and functionality of the UI and file parsing into structs and meta files. 
               Currently I am making enhancements to all parts of Lynx which can be viewed at its GitHub linked below. You will also find below a working
                example of Lynx between a Linux Debian Guest Virtual Machine and a Windows 10 Host. </p>

                Since these are most likely still part of the Western Carolina Computer Science curriculum, I cannot post 
                the source code for these projects here to avoid cheating.

                I am building a web application which will frequently stream newest comments in a thread.
                Similar applications have already been built, my plan is to make the experience more simplistic and include full screen functionality.
                Main usages would be to stream comments from live sports or news events.
                Written in Python using Django, see below for link to the project's GitHub.
